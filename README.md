By having access to different religious texts, the application will provide universal utility and applicability instead of having to access multiple sources for different text. It is important to contemplate and understand the possible criticisms that others may have against any conviction or argument, and the ability to comprehend the associated justifications for said objections will support one's conviction and further aid in healthy discourse by providing credence to the assertion and demonstrate an individual's diligence in researching and constructing an argument for or against a belief or ideology. 
# Citation, Search
From the displayed chapter, the user can generate the desired verses with an in-text citation that is formatted to the user's choice of citation format. The citation formats available are APA, MLA, and Turabian. The application will include a search bar for querying verses within the selected text that the contain the queried keyword(s). Additionally, there is a Biblical theme search option that returns corresponding verses what correlate to the theme. If either search values for keyword or search value are not found in the Bible or in the theme database, the application will display an error message notifying the user that the word, phrase, or theme was not found. From the list of theme and keyword verses, the user can select a verse and open it in the main text area to view the chapter text. 
# GUI Options
	The user interface includes two additional options. The first is the ability to adjust the size of the displayed text. However there is a maximum and minimum limit to the size of the text font. The second option a button that allows the user to change the colors of the application from dark to light mode.
